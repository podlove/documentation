Seasons allow you to group episodes. Some podcasts are inherently seasonal, for example when they follow sport-seasons. Others change their format once in a while or restart broadcasting after a summer break. The seasons module can help to realize this within the Publisher.

## Configuration

Once you activate the module, you will find the new menu entry "Podlove > Seasons".

- **Title**: If you leave the title empty, seasons will be named automatically. "Season 1", "Season 2" etc.
- **Subtitle & Summary**: Optional further descriptions of the season.
- **Start Date**: Each season has a start date. End dates are determined automatically. The first season does not need a start date.
- **Image**: Optional season image.

## Usage

You can access seasons through the Template API.

List all seasons through `podcast.seasons` or access the season of an episode through `episode.season`. For a list of all season attributes, see [Template Reference: Season](/reference/template-tags/#season).
